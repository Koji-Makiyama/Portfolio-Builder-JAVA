I created this program to apply my knowledge of Java to create a simulated profile creation sequence.
The program prompts you to enter input into the command line interface. 
Each input is saved as a separate attribute of a portfolio object in Java.
After you have completed building your portfolio, you are asked if you wish to export it as a .ser file.
If you select yes, it will create a .ser file in your local storage. Otherwise it will terminate.
