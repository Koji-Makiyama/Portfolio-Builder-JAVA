I created this program to apply my knowledge of Java to create a simulated profile creation sequence.
The program prompts you to enter input into the command line interface. 
Each input is saved as a separate attribute of a portfolio object in Java.
After you have completed building your portfolio, you are asked if you wish to export it as a .ser file.
If you select yes, it will create a .ser file in your local storage. Otherwise it will terminate.

ATTENTION: /n
This repository includes .java files that need to be compiled by the Java compiler into class files before being ran.
You can do this via your preferred IDE or via Windows CLI / Apple's Terminal / Linux CLI, etc.

FOR WINDOWS:/n
Extract the cloned zip file./n
Open the Command Prompt./n
Use 'cd' (change directory) to navigate to the extracted folder./n
Enter 'javac Main.java'/n
Enter 'java Main'/n
And the program should begin prompting you with messages!
